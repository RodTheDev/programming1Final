THE ORIGINATOR 1's are originals. Coming up with new ideas
and executing them is natural. Having things their own way is another
trait that gets them as being stubborn and arrogant. 1's are extremely
honest and do well to learn some diplomacy skills. They like to take
the initiative and are often leaders or bosses, as they like to be the
best. Being self-employed is definitely helpful for them. Lesson to
learn: Others' ideas might be just as good or better and to stay open
minded. Famous 1's: Tom Hanks, Robert Redford, Hulk Hogan, Carol
Burnett, Wynona Judd, Nancy Reagan, Raque l Welch.
